Minors will\\r\\n             provide assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients with stored stem cells will be treated at the escalating dose while patients\\r\\n             with no stem cells will be treated at the 50 mCi dose. Neuroblastoma patients can be\\r\\n             treated at the 50 mCi dose with or without stored stem cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Subject Exclusion Criteria:\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients with obstructive or symptomatic communicating hydrocephalus.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients with an uncontrolled life-threatening infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients who are pregnant: Pregnant women are excluded for fear of danger to the\\r\\n             fetus. Therefore negative pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing\\r\\n             age, and appropriate contraception is required during the study period.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients who have received cranial or spinal irradiation less than 3 weeks prior to\\r\\n             the start of this protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Patients who have received systemic chemotherapy (corticosteroids not included) less\\r\\n             than 3 weeks prior to the start of this protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n          -  Severe major organ toxicity. Specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and\\r\\n             gastrointestinal system toxicity should all be less than grade 2. Patients with stable\\r\\n             neurological deficits (because of their brain tumor) are not excluded. Patients with\\r\\n             <= 3 hearing loss are not excluded.\\r\\n      '}"
